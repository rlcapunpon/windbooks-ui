🛠 Implementation Guidelines

Tailwind Config Update

Extend Tailwind config with this palette (background, text, accent, state).

Make the new colors accessible via bg-background, text-primary, accent-blue, etc.

Apply Palette Across Pages

Login & Register Pages:

Use bg-background for full page.

Place forms in a bg-background-surface card with rounded corners, shadow-2xl, and slight transparency (bg-white/5 backdrop-blur).

Inputs: bg-input, border-input, focus:ring-accent-blue.

Buttons: gradient from-accent-blue via-accent-purple to-accent-cyan with hover glow.

Dashboard:

Use bg-background-secondary for layout.

Header in bg-background-surface with text in text-primary.

Logout button styled with primary accent gradient.

Typography & Spacing

Apply font-sans (Inter/Poppins).

Maintain generous spacing (space-y-6, p-6, gap-4).

Responsiveness

Ensure components scale properly at sm, md, lg breakpoints.

Cards should be full-width on mobile, centered with max-width on larger screens.

Accessibility

Ensure color contrast for text.

All inputs should have labels and focus outlines (focus-visible).

✅ Deliverables

Updated Tailwind config with custom colors.

Updated styles on Login, Register, Dashboard pages using this palette.

All components (inputs, buttons, cards) styled consistently.

Fully responsive layout with futuristic, minimalistic look.
