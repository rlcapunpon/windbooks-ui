Redesign the existing Login, Register, and Dashboard pages using TailwindCSS to achieve a minimalistic and futuristic aesthetic.

🎨 Design Guidelines

Overall look: clean, futuristic, minimalistic.

Style inspiration: neumorphism + glassmorphism, subtle gradients, rounded corners, glowing hover/focus effects.

Color scheme: dark mode first (black/gray backgrounds, glowing cyan/blue/purple accents).

Typography: modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Poppins).

Containers: centered glassmorphic cards with blurred background, soft shadows, and rounded 2xl corners.

Inputs: full-width, minimal borders, glowing focus rings, subtle background transparency.

Buttons: full-width, bold typography, gradient backgrounds (blue → purple), hover states with glow.

Animations: smooth transitions using transition-all, hover scaling, and subtle framer-motion fade/slide-in.

📌 Page-Specific Design
🔑 Login & Register Pages

Centered card layout with frosted glass background.

Form fields stacked vertically with spacing.

Buttons full-width, gradient style.

Links (Forgot password?, Create account) styled as subtle glowing text buttons.

🖥 Dashboard Page

Minimal top navigation bar with logo/app name and logout button.

Content centered with a welcoming message (e.g., “Welcome back 🚀”).

Use grid or flex for layout, ensuring responsiveness on mobile.

On mobile: navigation collapses into a menu (hamburger or dropdown).

🛠 Technical Requirements

Use TailwindCSS utility classes only (no inline CSS).

Ensure responsiveness with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg).

Use backdrop-blur, bg-opacity, shadow-2xl, and gradient utilities for futuristic effects.

Ensure accessibility (labels for inputs, sufficient contrast, focus states).

Code must be clean, reusable, and extensible.

✅ Deliverables

Updated Tailwind classes applied to existing pages/components.

Consistent UI theme across Login, Register, and Dashboard.

Fully responsive design (tested at mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints).

Dark-mode-first aesthetic with futuristic styling.
