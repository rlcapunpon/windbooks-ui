# 10-10-25 - Organization Management Modal Styling ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Summary
**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/components/OrganizationTable/OrganizationTable.tsx`
- `src/components/OrganizationTable/OrganizationTable.test.tsx`
- `src/components/CreateOrganizationModal/CreateOrganizationModal.tsx`
- `checkpoint/10-10-25/CHECKPOINT.md`
- `prompts_and_contexts/test-files-inventory.md`

## Completed Features
✅ **Step 1: Delete Modal Behavior**
- Modified `handleDeleteConfirm` in `OrganizationTable.tsx` to move modal closing and page refresh to a `finally` block
- This ensures consistent UI behavior whether the delete succeeds or fails
- Added comprehensive test case to verify the behavior works correctly
- Updated test inventory to reflect the new test case

✅ **Step 2: Uniform Spacing in Create Organization Modal**
- Added `mt-6` class to the Last Name div container in Step 3 of CreateOrganizationModal
- This ensures consistent spacing between form fields in the Registrant Information section
- The change aligns the Last Name label spacing with other fields in the form

## Technical Implementation
**Delete Modal Fix**:
```tsx
const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
  try {
    await OrganizationService.deleteOrganization(organization.id);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to delete organization:', error);
  } finally {
    setShowDeleteModal(false);
    window.location.reload();
  }
};
```

**Spacing Fix**:
```tsx
<div className="mt-6">
  <label htmlFor="lastName" className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
    Last Name
  </label>
  {/* input field */}
</div>
```

## Test Coverage
- **OrganizationTable**: Added test for delete failure scenario (modal closes and refreshes)
- **CreateOrganizationModal**: Verified styling changes don't break functionality
- **Full Test Suite**: 796 passed, 1 skipped
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful

## TDD Process Validation
- ✅ Written failing tests first for both steps
- ✅ Implemented minimal code changes to pass tests  
- ✅ Verified delete modal closes and refreshes regardless of API result
- ✅ Verified Last Name field has uniform spacing (mt-6 class)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Git commits made for each step
